* Why?

Because I utterly suck at code and I should probably implement anything that works to remedy this.
Additionally, this seems simple enough and is actually useful.

Useful? Well yes, while it's true that nitrogen has, and will continue to, satisfy my needs.
this is just an exercise and a yak shave. My minor issue is that nitrogen
relies on the mouse. I use i3, emacs, and vimperator; I'm not a mouse person.

* Code

I am using a library to display the image as swing scares me.
I'm using /hu.kazocsaba/imageview 1.2.3/.
#+TODO This should eventually be optional.
